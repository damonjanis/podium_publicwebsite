In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with a reasonable expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. Prior to making any investment, User will be required to provide supporting documents proving that User is an Accredited Investor.  Alternatively, User may use a third-party verification provider.  User’s failure to provide any information and documentation requested to confirm User’s status as an Accredited Investor will be cause for the Company to discontinue User’s access to the Site.</p><p>Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence.
